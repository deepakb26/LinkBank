#### ~ Applying for opportunities made a little easier ~

When applying for opportunities we often have to submit links to our profiles across different platforms such as Github,LinkedIn, Medium etc. 

Now what if you had all these links stored in an extension, keeping them just one click away?

All your links, one click away. No more browsing for your url and then coming back to the application page.. with LinkBank you can do it all in one shot.
